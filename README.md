$Acceptance Criteria

$Create a resource for animal with the following information: common name and scientific binomial.

$ rails generate resource Animal common_name:string scientific_binomial:string
$ rails routes -E   //will show all accessable routes//
$ rails db:migrate  // will update the schema//
$ rails c   and start building by // adding new information into DB//

$Add few animals in terminal rails c
 Animal.create common_name:"Lion", scientific_binomial:"Panthera leo"

 Animal.create common_name:"Tiger", scientific_binomial:"Panthera tigris"

 Animal.create common_name:"Jaguar", scientific_binomial:"Panthera onca"

Done

$In WILDANIMAL-API app, make all the required CRUD actions in the animals_controller.rb file
After this you should see the data response of all the animals in Postman app. Make sure you run the server rails s in terminal. 


$IN Postman app

$GET url: localhost/3000/animals
select JSON from the Body field to see the output in an array of objects.
Done

$Can create a new animal in the database

$In Postman app

$SELECT HTTML VERB "POST" FROM DROP-DOWN LIST.
URL localhost:3000/animals
Select "Body"
Select "raw"
Select "JSON"

{"common_name": "Zebra", 
 "scientific_binomial": "Equus zebra"
}

Should see an output return of with Status: 200 Ok with a standand response for successful HTTP request. If we had not rendered joson: animal, we would have had a stautus code with a 204 No Content, eventhough it was still pushed in i.e because nothing to show.
